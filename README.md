Java Conditions and If Statements
You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Less than: a < b

Less than or equal to: a <= b

Greater than: a > b

Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Equal to a == b

Not Equal to: a != b

You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Java has the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.

Syntax

if (condition) {

  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
  
}

The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition) {

  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
  
} else {

  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
  
}

The else if Statement
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition1) {

  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
  
} else if (condition2) {

  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  
} else {

  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
  
}
